    <p>
        My mom works at <i>Lutheran High School South</i>, the high school that I attended in St. Louis. She works in admissions and works on many different things at the school. I absolutely love my mom's cooking and is one of the things I really miss about being away at school.

<h2>Dad</h2>
    <p>
        My dad works as an attorney at <a href="https://www.smithamundsen.com/">SmithAmundsen</a> a law firm in St. Louis. I love watching different shows with my dad as we watched <b>The Walking Dead</b> and <b> Mandalorian</b> together.

<h2>Sister</h2>
    <p>
        My older sister Allison graduated from Truman State University with her undergrad in creative writing. She now attends Minnesota State University - Mankato where she eventually wishes to get her PhD and teach writing at the collegiate level.
