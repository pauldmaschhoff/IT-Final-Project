            Coming from St. Louis I have always been following our   city's sports teams. I love following different 
            teams and getting invested in the different ups and downs that come in a season. Some of my favorite teams are:</div>
                <ul>
                    <li> St. Louis Cardinals (Baseball)</li>
                    <li> Kansas City Chiefs (Football) </li>
                    <li> St. Louis Blues (Hockey)</li>
                </ul>

    <h2> Video Games</h2>
    Ever since I was in elementary school playing Wii Sports on the Nintendo Wii I have had a love for video games. As   technology has evolved 
    I can now play online games with friends such as:<i> Destiny, Overwatch, Call of Duty</i> and many more. <a href = "https://www.xbox.com/en-US/">Xbox</a> has brought many good times to me and my friends and I look forward to the good times to come.
