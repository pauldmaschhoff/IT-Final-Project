            Coming from St. Louis I have always been following our   city's sports teams. I love following different 
            teams and getting invested in the different ups and downs that come in a season. Some of my favorite teams are:</div>
                <ul>
                    <li> St. Louis Cardinals (Baseball)</li>
                    <li> Kansas City Chiefs (Football) </li>
                    <li> St. Louis Blues (Hockey)</li>
                </ul>
